# CI/CD Pipeline on AWS
This project is focused on building a complete CI/CD pipeline on AWS to automatically deploy a containerized 
application whenever code changes are committed. This pipeline uses AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild to 
automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code. Amazon ECS is also used to containerize and
deploy the application within the pipeline.

## Building Docker Image
> The Code used for the 2048 game that was used for the CI/CD pipeline was cloned from a existing repository.
> `git clone https://github.com/techwithlucy/ztc-projects.git`
